The performant way to disable is: don’t compile / don’t run the effect at all
In your current architecture you already have the tools to do this:
Per‑scene graph build:
When a scene (or transition) changes, you call rebuildGraph() and build a different node graph:
If the scene needs SSAO, build a graph (or pipeline) that includes SSAO.
If it doesn’t, build a graph that simply never wires in that code.
Result: the SSAO code is not in the compiled shader for that scene combo.
Per‑scene / per‑pipeline passes:
For truly heavy stuff, you can keep them as separate fullscreen passes:
Scene A: renderScene → SSAO pass → colorGrading pass → transition pass
Scene B: renderScene → colorGrading pass → transition pass
You simply don’t call renderer.render for the SSAO mesh when the scene doesn’t use SSAO, so there’s zero AO cost.
Practical rule of thumb
Cheap / mid‑weight screen‑space effects (grade, vignette, basic distortion, simple outlines):
Keep them in your single Option‑A fullscreen pass, and enable/disable by changing the graph on scene switch (so unused effects don’t even compile).
Mega effects (multi‑tap DOF, SSAO, multi‑stage bloom, very dense sampling):
Give them:
Their own node material(s), and
Their own fullscreen pass(es),
and only:
Create those materials once (on scene setup / transition setup, not per frame), and
Render those passes only for scenes that use them.
This way Option A is still your backbone (one main post pass), and your heavy screen‑space effects are completely absent—not just “if’d off”—for scenes that don’t need them.
